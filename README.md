# Artificial Intelligence Master's Projects
### Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science - University of Bucharest

***This repository is meant to help Artificial Intelligence students pursuing their Master's Degrees.***

***This work was inspired by people like:***
- ***[Palcu](https://github.com/palcu/fmi) and [Marian Lupascu](https://github.com/marianlupascu/Bachelors-Projects) (during my bachelor's degree)***
- ***[Marian Lupascu](https://github.com/marianlupascu/Masters-Projects) and [Cllaire](https://github.com/Cllaire/FMI) (during my master's degree)***

***Their work helped me a lot, and probably others too.***

***So... this is my way of saying thank you and giving something back to the community.***

***Years: 2020-2022***

## Before you start
***Please take note that, I strongly discourage the use of an assignment "as is" or "copying and pasting" what you don't understand. Each project should represent an idea to start or maybe another perspective to approach the problem or help in case you are completely lost :)***

***Also, each assignment was passed through the plagiarism software (Turnitin), so if you reuse code, you are likely to be caught and the penalties go up to expulsion.***

## Other details
*<sup>1</sup> The Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery course does not have a particular repo because for me was easy and no preparation was needed. It was just a one-day presentation exam with my 3-member team, my colleague did the presentation, and I just talked "out-of-the-box" about SVM and Random Forrest. The only thing I can help with here it's the Task Requirements file for the exam: [Data-Mining-Cerinte-2020-2021-v2.pdf](https://github.com/AdrianIordache/AI-Master-Projects/files/11128870/Data.Mining.Cerinte.2020-2021.v2.pdf)*

*<sup>2</sup> Practical Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning were supposed to be 10/10. Still, those were 9.4/10, rounded to 9/10, due to an allegedly plagiarised decode function from the internet at the Kaggle Competition during the Practical Machine Learning course and one failed test case of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning - Assignment 1.*
